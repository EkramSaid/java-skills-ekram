In the shadow of the crescent-shaped cliffs that bordered the sleepy village of Elmsworth, young Callen stumbled upon a brittle parchment buried beneath the roots of an ancient oak. The map was inked in a language no elder could read, and shimmered faintly under the moonlight as though alive. Whispers rode the night wind whenever the map was near—soft, beckoning voices that spoke of hidden paths and forbidden places deep within the Whispering Woods. Though many feared the forest and its strange melodies, Callen felt an irresistible pull, as if the trees themselves were calling him to awaken a tale long forgotten.
