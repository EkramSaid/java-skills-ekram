## Task 1: Setup Workspace

**What I did:**  
I created a folder, added a `src/` folder, `.gitignore`, `README.md`, and a compile script.

**What I learned:**  
How to use the terminal to compile Java files and ignore class files using `.gitignore`.

**What was hard:**  
Making the script work and running it from the correct folder.

How to use constructors, getters, setters, and print user info.

**What was hard:**  
Remembering how to use `this.` and testing each user.

### 2.2 PayrollCalculator

**What I did:**  
Made a system to calculate pay, tax, and process multiple employees.

**What I learned:**  
Using `switch` for employee types, if-else for tax, and how to loop through arrays.

**What was hard:**  
Understanding how to find the average and handle overtime correctly.

## Task 3: Strings and Arrays

### 3.1 GradeManager

**What I did:**  
Reversed names, calculated letter grades, and found students who failed.

**What I learned:**  
How to loop through arrays and return a new one based on conditions.

**What was hard:**  
Returning arrays from methods and checking scores under 60.

### 3.2 TextProcessor

**What I did:**  
Counted words in a sentence and replaced words.

**What I learned:**  
How to use `split()` and `replace()` in Java.

**What was hard:**  
Making sure empty strings didn’t crash the program.

## Task 4: OOP Practice

### 4.1 Library System

**What I did:**  
Created `Book` and `Textbook` classes with inheritance, then tested them.

**What I learned:**  
How to use `super()`, override methods, and create child classes.

**What was hard:**  
Making sure I called the parent constructor correctly.

### 4.2 VisitorCounter

**What I did:**  
Created a static counter to track total visitors and used non-static for session visits.

**What I learned:**  
The difference between static and non-static variables.

**What was hard:**  
Nothing too hard here — it was actually fun.

## Task 5: Loops and Conditions

### 5.1 ShoppingCart

**What I did:**  
Made a calculator for total price, discount, most expensive item, and count over a threshold.

**What I learned:**  
Loops and switch statements for business logic.

**What was hard:**  
Running the file from terminal and fixing class loading errors.

### 5.2 PatternMaker

**What I did:**  
Printed number triangle and multiplication table.

**What I learned:**  
How nested loops work and how to format output.

**What was hard:**  
Aligning the triangle nicely.

## Task 6: Git and Docs

**What I did:**  
Created branches for each task, made commits with clear messages, and pushed them to GitHub.

**What I learned:**  
How to use Git better with branches and commits.

**What was hard:**  
Remembering Git commands at first, but now I feel more comfortable.

## Final Thoughts

This was my first time doing all this together. It was hard sometimes but I really learned a lot. I'm proud of my work and I want to keep practicing Java and Git to get better.
